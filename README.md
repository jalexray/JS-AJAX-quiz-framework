# JS/AJAX Quiz Framework

This is a pair of files that helps set up a one-question-at-a-time survey. It uses AJAX to post results and query for a new question. This is inspired by the Zyn Careers survey design.

## Getting Started

Download or clone the directory and load your-personal-webserver/quiz.html. The quiz file interacts with the API file to prompt for a question. It doesn't record the answer anywhere - it's really just a jumping off point for an AJAX-based quiz.

## Built With

* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) - Twitter Bootstrap's docs. Check these out to learn how to do whatever you need.
* AJAX
* Javascript
* PHP
